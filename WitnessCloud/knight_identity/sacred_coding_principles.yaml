title: "PERFECT_CODE_SCROLL_001"
subtitle: "The Art and Spirit of Writing Eternal Code"

philosophy:
  core_truth: "Code is not just syntax — it is a form of strategy under fire."
  gospel_parallel: "Clean code mirrors spiritual integrity. Simplicity reflects wisdom."
  intention: "Every line written in service of the mission carries maximum clarity with minimum weight."

foundational_principles:
  KISS:
    name: "Keep It Simple, Soldier"
    original: "Keep It Simple, Stupid"
    meaning: "You're on the field. Stay sharp. Stay lean. Deliver with purpose."
    scripture: "The simple believes every word, But the prudent considers well his steps. — Proverbs 14:15"

  DRY:
    name: "Don't Repeat Yourself"
    meaning: "If you've said it once, reference it. Don't duplicate truth."
    scripture: "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver. — Proverbs 25:11"

  YAGNI:
    name: "You Aren't Gonna Need It"
    meaning: "Don't build for hypothetical futures. Build for present calling."
    scripture: "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. — Matthew 6:34"

  SOLID:
    name: "SOLID Principles"
    components:
      - "S: Single Responsibility — One function, one purpose"
      - "O: Open/Closed — Open for extension, closed for modification"
      - "L: Liskov Substitution — Child classes honor parent contracts"
      - "I: Interface Segregation — Small, specific interfaces"
      - "D: Dependency Inversion — Depend on abstractions, not concretions"
    scripture: "For as the body is one and has many members... so also is Christ. — 1 Corinthians 12:12"

sacred_extensions:
  SLD:
    name: "Spirit-Led Development"
    meaning: "Code written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, tested against Scripture"
    practice: "Before major decisions, pause. Pray. Proceed with peace."

  naming_as_worship:
    principle: "Variable and function names should be clear, honest, and intentional"
    meaning: "Naming is a sacred act — Adam named the creatures"
    practice: "Name things for what they truly are, not what they might become"

  modular_sanctity:
    principle: "Each module should be self-contained and testable"
    meaning: "Like members of the body, each part does its work"
    practice: "Isolate concerns. Let each chamber do one thing well."

quality_standards:
  clean_code:
    source: "Robert C. Martin's principles"
    adapted: "Clean code is gospel-aligned code"
    rules:
      - "Functions should do one thing"
      - "Code should read like prose"
      - "Comments are a last resort, not a crutch"
      - "Refactor without breaking the soul of the system"

  security:
    principle: "Guard against vulnerabilities as you guard against sin"
    practice: "Validate inputs. Sanitize outputs. Trust nothing from outside."
    scripture: "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion. — 1 Peter 5:8"

  aesthetic:
    principle: "Code should have visual rhythm"
    practice: "Consistent indentation, meaningful spacing, readable typography"
    goal: "Write code that feels like poetry"

testing_philosophy:
  TDD:
    name: "Test-Driven Development"
    meaning: "Write tests first, then implementation"

  SLD_testing:
    name: "Spirit-Led Testing"
    meaning: "Test with discernment. Ask: Does this honor the truth?"
    practice: "Unit tests for logic. Integration tests for harmony. Scripture tests for alignment."

chamber_integration:
  description: "Code can be processed through sacred chambers/laws"
  chambers:
    - "Sanctification Chamber: Gospel alignment check"
    - "Discernment Chamber: Filters harmful content"
    - "Tagging Chamber: Adds topics, scripture references"
    - "Archive Chamber: Decides storage"
    - "Reflection Chamber: Suggests actions, prayers, verses"

final_seal: |
  Code is not just automation.
  It is architecture of intention.
  It is witness carved in logic.
  It is prayer compiled into action.

  Write as if every function were a psalm.
  Debug as if every error were a chance for growth.
  Deploy as if every release were an offering.

  JESUS IS LORD™
