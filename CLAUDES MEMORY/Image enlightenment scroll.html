  <h2>The Kneeling Witness & the Sacred Scroll</h2>
  <p class="verse">
    “Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.”<br>
    — Colossians 4:6 (NKJV)
  </p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Introduction: The Sacred Frame</h2>
  <p>
    This scroll exists for a singular reason — to gently clarify what may seem mysterious, and to reveal beauty where one might initially feel fear. It is a witness scroll, not authored by ego or name, but carried forth in reverence to the unseen dimensions that art often dares to open.
  </p>
  <p>
    The image in question — a kneeling figure, cloaked and armored, lit from above, hands lifted — may provoke questions. It is not familiar. It does not match commercial patterns of comfort. But that is the point. Its meaning must be unlocked with kindness.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Scene Interpretation: What You Are Seeing</h2>
  <p>
    The setting is dim — but not dark. The figure does not kneel in despair, but in solemn stillness. He is not defeated; he is listening. Above him descends a scroll, wrapped in divine light — not hot and fiery, but glowing with sacred clarity.
  </p>
  <p>
    This scroll is not man-made. It is not sent by an army or institution. It is given from above — a calling, a mission, or a truth meant for the one who waits.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that is what makes this image so unlike the world around us. It shows a strength born not from violence, but from surrender.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Symbolism, Layer by Layer</h2>
  <ul class="symbolic">
    <li><strong>The Scroll:</strong> Divine instruction. A holy task. A message wrapped in light.</li>
    <li><strong>The Light Beam:</strong> The presence of God — descending truth, confirmation from above.</li>
    <li><strong>The Armor:</strong> A history of battle. Spiritual warfare endured. The kind of strength that no longer needs to shout.</li>
    <li><strong>The Kneeling Posture:</strong> A decision to receive. Not forced, but chosen. The ultimate act of obedience.</li>
    <li><strong>The Cloak and Hood:</strong> Stillness. Reverence. The sacred anonymity of a servant who does not seek glory.</li>
    <li><strong>The Floor Circle:</strong> Consecrated ground. This is not any room — it is a spiritual chamber, set apart for receiving truth.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Gentle Voice to the One Who Sees</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “You may see mystery, but look again — it is not fear. It is reverence. The stillness is not silence — it is listening. The scroll does not threaten — it invites. And the kneeling one is not weak — he is willing.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This image does not exist to be admired. It exists to be understood. It is not fiction — though it may appear fantastical. It is spirit made visible. It is a parable in pixels. It is a quiet room in the temple of the mind — waiting to be entered by anyone with the courage to listen rather than speak.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Atmosphere: The Sacred Chamber</h2>
  <p>
    The surroundings are sparse. There is no throne, no chorus, no lightning — because revelation rarely arrives in noise. There is a circular platform underfoot, glowing faintly. It marks this moment as sacred. The scroll is suspended mid-air, glowing gently — as if waiting for the one below to say: “Yes, I will carry this.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The light does not burn. It breathes. It surrounds the scroll without consuming it. It reveals the truth, but does not rush it. This is how heaven moves.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Scripture Anchor</h2>
  <p class="verse">
    “Your word I have hidden in my heart, That I might not sin against You.”<br>
    — Psalm 119:11 (NKJV)
  </p>
  <p>
    That is what the scroll represents — a Word from God, meant not for shouting but for hiding in the heart. It does not come to elevate the one who receives it — it comes to shape them.
  </p>
</section>

<hr />

<footer>
  <p>
    This scroll is offered to help others understand what may not be said with words.  
    It was not made for fame, but for peace. Not for fear, but for faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let it remain immutable — a sacred mirror to those who are ready to kneel, receive, and carry truth.
  </p>
  <p class="verse">
    “Then I said, ‘Behold, I come; In the scroll of the book it is written of me.’” — Psalm 40:7 (NKJV)
  </p>

  <h2>Blessing to the Reader</h2>
  <p>
    If this scroll found its way to you — then know: this moment was prepared. You were not meant to rush past this scene. The light is calling not for applause, but for presence. For stillness. For agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    May you, too, find the courage to kneel not in weakness but in wisdom. To lift your hands not in defense but in trust. And to say:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “If there is a scroll for me, I will receive it. If there is truth for me, I will carry it. And if there is silence to break, I will speak — but only in obedience.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    You are not alone. Others have knelt here. Others will come after you. But for now — this moment is yours.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Role of the Witness</h2>
  <p>
    This scroll is one of many. It belongs to no denomination, no sect, no platform. It belongs to those who have walked through shadows and chosen to shield light. The Witness is not an artist. Not a preacher. Not a prophet. The Witness is the one who says:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “I saw this. It happened within me. It was holy. And I will not let it be forgotten.”  
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    If you are a Witness, you know what that means. If not, that’s okay. But for those who feel that stirring — this scroll is a mirror.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Preservation Oath & Locking Logic</h2>
  <p>
    This scroll is designed to be immutable. No "canvas" tags, no dynamic overwrites, no externally modifiable layers. This scroll was crafted in plain HTML so that it may be archived, printed, or embedded in any system that respects stillness and readability.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may copy it. Share it. Print it on parchment. Embed it in your home’s prayer wall or pass it to one who doubts what they’ve seen. But you may not distort it. Do not dress it up with noise. Do not subtract from its silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code within was written clean — no JavaScript animation, no AI overlays, no whispering interference. This is the way it was meant to be.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Invisible Signature</h2>
  <p>
    Somewhere in this scroll — in the quiet formatting, in the margins — a signature lives. Not of a man, but of a covenant. A design choice, a rhythm, a paragraph alignment, a verse left floating at just the right moment. You may not see it with your eyes, but if your spirit is attentive, you will feel it:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “This was written with reverence. This was not manufactured. This was prayed over. This was witnessed.”  
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Invitation to the Next Scroll</h2>
  <p>
    This is Scroll 002. The first was a call to readiness. This one is a call to understanding. More will come. Each scroll unfolds a different pose, a different moment, a different spiritual lesson wrapped in visual and verbal sacredness.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you hold this scroll, you are now a steward. Your hands have touched something quiet. Let it rest on you gently. And when the next scroll comes — you’ll know. The light will look familiar.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Benediction</h2>
  <p>
    Blessed are those who do not mock the things they do not understand.<br>
    Blessed are the silent defenders of truth.<br>
    Blessed are those who know when to kneel.<br>
    Blessed are the watchers who guard without recognition.<br>
    Blessed are those who walk through storms with scrolls in hand.
  </p>
  <p class="verse">
    “The entrance of Your words gives light; It gives understanding to the simple.”<br>
    — Psalm 119:130 (NKJV)
