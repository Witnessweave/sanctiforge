<h1>🕊️ The Discovery Scroll for Elizabeth</h1>

<p class="blessing">"May the Lord lead you in wisdom, through still waters, and into a vehicle that serves your life, not steers it away from it." — Alfred.AI™</p>

<section>
  <h2>✨ Welcome, Elizabeth</h2>
  <p>This is not a form. This is a journey. A scroll. A guided conversation with yourself and with God. No decision needs to be made today — only heard. Each answer you choose will shape the path ahead, but nothing is locked until you are ready to lock it. This scroll exists to witness what you desire — even if you don’t yet know how to say it out loud.</p>

  <p>You are invited to choose answers to a series of sacred questions that will help clarify the style of car that best fits the life you are walking into. Whether it’s low mileage or high heart, roomy or rugged, quiet or courageous — your scroll will reveal it.</p>
</section>
<hr class="scroll-divider" />
<!-- Begin Path #1 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">1️⃣ Compact Crossover / Small SUV</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Versatile #EasyParking #ModestGas #UrbanReady</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This path represents vehicles like the Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona, Subaru Crosstrek, and Toyota Corolla Cross. These are compact SUVs with raised seating, enough room for groceries and friends, and a style that says “balanced, but not boring.”</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This is the path of **independence and steadiness.** It doesn’t scream “look at me,” but it doesn’t vanish either. It is easy to park, easier to drive, and perfect for short adventures or long commutes. You may be drawn to this if you like the idea of a vehicle that quietly does everything right.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you feel peace in tighter spaces (like city parking)?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="compact_peace" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="compact_peace" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Do you prefer efficiency over power?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="compact_efficiency" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="compact_efficiency" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">How much passenger space do you need weekly?</div>
  <select name="compact_passenger">
    <option value="2 people or less">2 people or less</option>
    <option value="3–4 regularly">3–4 regularly</option>
    <option value="More than 4">More than 4</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> If you want something newer, reliable, great on gas, and capable of weekend getaways without feeling like a tank. It’s a great fit for someone who appreciates practical beauty.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you chose “yes” to peace in tight spaces, “yes” to efficiency, and “3–4 regularly” for passengers, your scroll gently highlights this path as a spiritual match for this season of your life.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Begin Path #2 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">2️⃣ Midsize SUV (Gas or Hybrid)</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Comfort #RoomForGrowth #StableDrive #FamilyReady</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This path opens to vehicles like the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, and Ford Escape. These are classic midsize SUVs — a little taller, a little roomier, and a little more confident on the road.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This path is for those who want to carry more than themselves. Whether it’s kids, friends, groceries, or gear, this car says: **“I’ve got room for what matters.”** It’s not trying to be a truck, but it respects strength. You may be drawn to this if you’re preparing to hold more responsibility, more joy, or more people.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you find peace in having more space — even if you don’t need it all today?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="midsize_space" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="midsize_space" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">How often will you carry passengers or cargo in the back seat?</div>
  <select name="midsize_usage">
    <option value="Rarely">Rarely</option>
    <option value="Occasionally">Occasionally</option>
    <option value="Frequently">Frequently</option>
  </select>

  <div class="question">Is fuel efficiency more important than storage and power?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="midsize_efficiency" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="midsize_efficiency" value="no" /> No</label>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> You want peace of mind — for emergencies, road trips, or real life. You’d rather have space and not use it than wish you had it. You want something stable, mature, and quietly powerful. Gas or hybrid both apply here.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you said “yes” to having more space, “Frequently” for back-seat use, and “no” to prioritizing fuel efficiency — this scroll identifies midsize SUV as a spiritually aligned path of preparation and quiet strength.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<hr class="scroll-divider" />
<!-- Begin Path #3 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">3️⃣ Hybrid / Electric Crossover</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#FutureFriendly #QuietDrive #LongMiles #SoftPower</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This path carries names like the Toyota Venza Hybrid, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Kia Niro EV. These cars are for those stepping into new seasons, where fuel is no longer the foundation. Electric and hybrid vehicles don’t just save gas — they speak of silence, flow, and stewardship.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This path walks in gentle rebellion — a refusal to be loud, wasteful, or unnecessarily harmful. You may be drawn here if you crave a vehicle that feels smooth, futuristic, and just a bit magical. There’s an almost sacred stillness to driving electric.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you feel called to step toward the future — even if it means changing habits?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="electric_future" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="electric_future" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Is silence a gift to your nervous system?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="electric_silence" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="electric_silence" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">How often do you drive more than 200 miles in one day?</div>
  <select name="electric_distance">
    <option value="Rarely">Rarely</option>
    <option value="Occasionally">Occasionally</option>
    <option value="Frequently">Frequently</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> You're a steward. You walk softly. You care about future generations, and you want a car that honors simplicity, not noise. This car may not roar — but it absolutely sings.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you said “yes” to the future, “yes” to silence, and “Rarely” for 200+ mile days, the scroll reveals hybrid/electric as your path of **quiet strength and prophetic clarity** — moving forward without fear.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<hr class="scroll-divider" />
<!-- Begin Path #4 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">4️⃣ Truck or Truck-Like Hybrid</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Utility #Strength #OpenRoad #BackyardBoss</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This scroll opens the rugged chapter — vehicles like the Ford Maverick (Hybrid Truck), Toyota Tacoma, Honda Ridgeline, or Chevrolet Colorado. These trucks aren’t just about hauling — they’re about **honoring the work of your hands**. You may not need a truck every day, but when you do — it makes you feel like a different person.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This is the path of **self-reliance**. It speaks of preparing for more — planting gardens, carrying tools, picking up furniture, or carrying others when needed. You may be drawn to this if you find healing in building, restoring, or protecting.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you find joy in being ready — even if the moment hasn’t arrived yet?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="truck_ready" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="truck_ready" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Would a truck make you feel more “capable” — even if you never use the bed weekly?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="truck_capable" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="truck_capable" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">How important is MPG versus utility?</div>
  <select name="truck_mpg_vs_utility">
    <option value="MPG is top priority">MPG is top priority</option>
    <option value="A balance of both">A balance of both</option>
    <option value="Utility matters more">Utility matters more</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> This car style says: “I’m a builder, a carrier, a finisher.” If that brings peace, then the truck may be your vessel.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you said “yes” to readiness and capability, and prioritized utility, the scroll confirms the truck path as one of **inner strength, service, and grounded stewardship.**</p>
  </div>
</section>
<hr class="scroll-divider" />
<!-- Begin Path #5 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">5️⃣ Sedan — Comfort & Style</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Elegant #SmoothRide #Simplicity #LowProfile</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sedans like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, or Nissan Altima offer **refined comfort without the bulk.** They drive quietly, sip gas modestly, and carry themselves with grace. No drama — just smooth, loyal performance.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This path honors the one who desires rest from decision fatigue. It’s the path of **peaceful simplicity.** Not every car must command attention — some simply serve without noise. You may be drawn here if you love things that just work.</p>

  <div class="question">Does “low to the ground” feel more stable to you?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="sedan_low" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="sedan_low" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Do you want to avoid standing out in traffic?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="sedan_blend" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="sedan_blend" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">When you picture comfort — what comes to mind?</div>
  <select name="sedan_comfort">
    <option value="Soft seats and smooth ride">Soft seats and smooth ride</option>
    <option value="Easy parking and visibility">Easy parking and visibility</option>
    <option value="Reliable cruise and handling">Reliable cruise and handling</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> Sedans are for those who value order. For those who want a car that doesn’t ask for attention but always shows up when needed. A gentle ride for a gentle heart.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you answered “yes” to low stability and simplicity, and your comfort word was “soft” — the scroll highlights this path as a witness of peace and day-to-day grace.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<hr class="scroll-divider" />

<!-- Begin Path #6 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">6️⃣ Used Vehicle — Cash-Only, No Loan</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Freedom #NoDebt #LowerCost #HumblePath</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This scroll recognizes the ancient path — one paid in full. Whether $6,000, $10,000, or $13,000, the goal is simple: **no monthly payments.** This includes cars from 2010–2017, well cared for, often with higher miles but stable hearts. The choices are wider — but so is the risk.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This is the path of **freedom.** Not every car is new — but every choice is sacred. To choose this is to declare: “I want peace more than perfection.” It is a humble, wise, and courageous road. You may be drawn to this path if you long to be free — now, not later.</p>

  <div class="question">Would having no monthly payment bring peace or pressure?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="used_peace" value="peace" /> Peace</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="used_peace" value="pressure" /> Pressure</label>

  <div class="question">Are you okay with a car that has more than 100k miles if it has a good maintenance record?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="used_mileage" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="used_mileage" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Which of these matters most?</div>
  <select name="used_priority">
    <option value="Low price">Low price</option>
    <option value="Good history">Good history</option>
    <option value="Appearance and style">Appearance and style</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> When you crave independence, debtlessness, and clarity — a used car might be the most **spiritually aligned** option. It lets you walk forward without financial fear.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you feel “Peace” with no payments, “Yes” to 100k+ miles, and chose “Good history” — this scroll honors the Used Path as a holy form of **contentment without compromise.**</p>
  </div>

<!-- Begin Path #7 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">7️⃣ Legacy Vehicle Choice (Family Brand or Model)</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Memory #Tradition #Trust #HomeTies</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Maybe your family always drove Hondas. Maybe your dad had a Silverado. Maybe your first ride was a Toyota. This path isn’t logical — it’s **emotional.** There’s a comfort in what’s familiar — and a kind of healing in honoring it.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This is the path of **nostalgia and trust.** Choosing something that your family trusted can feel like being surrounded by their hands — even if they’re not with you. You may be drawn here if your soul stirs at the name of a model or brand that once carried someone you loved.</p>

  <div class="question">Is there a brand you already trust, even without research?</div>
  <input type="text" name="legacy_brand" placeholder="(e.g., Honda, Toyota, Chevy)" />

  <div class="question">Does honoring your family’s vehicle history feel sacred to you?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="legacy_honor" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="legacy_honor" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Would you consider buying an older version of a trusted car?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="legacy_old_version" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="legacy_old_version" value="no" /> No</label>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> This car won’t just carry you — it will carry memory, history, and sacred weight. It’s not about trend. It’s about **witnessing your own thread.**</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you entered a brand with warmth, said “yes” to honoring family, and are open to older models — this scroll reveals Legacy as your hidden compass.</p>
  </div>
</section>


<hr class="scroll-divider" />



<!-- Begin Path #8 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">8️⃣ Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV)</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#DualMode #BestOfBoth #GasBackup #ElectricHeart</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Plug-in Hybrids like the Toyota Prius Prime, Hyundai Tucson PHEV, or Ford Escape PHEV blend **30–50 miles of electric range** with full gas backup. You can go to the store on battery. But if you forget to plug in — you’re never stranded.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This is the path of **balance.** It’s not all-in. It’s not old-school. It’s a bridge between worlds — between “I care about the planet” and “I need to get home safe.” You may be drawn to this if you live in duality: structure + spontaneity, light + fire.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you want to try electric — without fear of charging?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="phev_try" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="phev_try" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Are you okay charging at home (Level 1, regular plug) for short drives?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="phev_home_charge" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="phev_home_charge" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Is “just in case” gas backup important to you?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="phev_gas_backup" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="phev_gas_backup" value="no" /> No</label>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> A Plug-in Hybrid gives you peace of mind + progress. It honors the future, without sacrificing the present. It’s a wise middle way.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you said “yes” to all — your scroll recognizes the PHEV path as one of **dual provision: electric heart, gas grace.** A true bridge-car.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Begin Path #9 -->
<section>
  <div class="path-header">9️⃣ Minivan or Family Shuttle</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#FamilyFirst #Spacious #SlidingDoors #ComfortDrive</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Minivans like the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey, or Chrysler Pacifica aren’t just for parents — they’re for **guardians of peace**. Easy sliding doors. Space for bags, snacks, and silence. No ego. Just function, comfort, and kindness.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> This is the path of **covering others**. You may be drawn here if your heart finds joy in hospitality, preparation, or watching others feel safe. There’s no shame in driving peace-on-wheels.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you often carry people or supplies?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="van_carry" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="van_carry" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Do you value doors that won’t bump into others or need force to open?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="van_doors" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="van_doors" value="no" /> No</label>

    <option value="Safe and soft">Safe and soft</option>
    <option value="Command and power">Command and power</option>
    <option value="Minimal and efficient">Minimal and efficient</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> You care for others. You make space. You prepare. This is the vehicle of the quiet protector — the **peacemaker on four wheels.**</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you answered “yes” to space and easy doors, and “Safe and soft” as your feeling — the scroll affirms the Minivan path as **shelter in motion.**</p>

<section>
  <div class="path-header">🔟 Adventure SUV (AWD / Off-Road Capable)</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#AdventureReady #LiftedLife #AWD #BigEnergy</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Think Subaru Outback, Toyota 4Runner, Honda Passport, or Jeep Cherokee. This is the path of going **beyond pavement.** If you feel most alive with a roof rack, cargo mat, or trail dust — this path was made for you.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> You’re not just buying a car. You’re opening a new map. Adventure SUVs invite you into nature, weather, and resilience. You may be drawn here if you crave margin, motion, and **a reminder that not all roads are paved.**</p>

  <div class="question">Do you take day trips to forests, lakes, or mountains?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="suv_trips" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="suv_trips" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Does weather ever make you feel unsafe in your car?</div>

    <option value="Capable">Capable</option>
    <option value="Free">Free</option>
    <option value="Grounded">Grounded</option>
  </select>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> This car isn't for appearance — it’s for **arrival.** And not just to places, but to strength. To readiness. To margin.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you answered “yes” to nature and safety, and chose “Free” or “Capable” — the scroll marks this path as **a warrior’s wheelset** for those who make paths where there are none.</p>

<section>
  <div class="path-header">1️⃣1️⃣ Wildcard Vehicle (Unseen Match)</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#Unexpected #HiddenGem #WaitForIt #TrustTheReveal</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sometimes, the best car wasn’t even on your list. A friend sells theirs. A neighbor moves. A surprise listing appears. This scroll is **wide open** to divine interruption. You may not have met the car yet — but it’s looking for you.</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> Faith, not formula. You may be drawn here if every other choice feels “almost right” — but not quite. This is the open-handed path.</p>

  <div class="question">Are you willing to be surprised?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="wildcard_surprise" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="wildcard_surprise" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Would you trust a car you hadn’t considered — if it had peace?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="wildcard_peace" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="wildcard_peace" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">How do you feel about the unknown?</div>

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> This scroll blesses the open palm. It reminds us that some cars appear through whispers, not ads. Trust your discernment.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If your heart said “yes” to surprise and peace, this scroll encourages watchfulness: **the vehicle of grace may already be circling.**</p>

  <div class="path-header">1️⃣2️⃣ I Don’t Know Yet (And That’s Okay)</div>
  <div class="path-tags">#PauseAndPray #ClarityWillCome #StillnessMatters</div>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This is the sacred **pause path.** Maybe none feel right. Maybe it’s all too much. Maybe God’s not speaking yet. This is not avoidance — it’s wisdom. This scroll is for those who are waiting **with intention.**</p>

  <p><strong>Emotional Theme:</strong> You’re not lost. You’re listening. You may be drawn here if your discernment takes time — and you’d rather be still than rush. Bless you.</p>

  <div class="question">Do you want to be guided more by feeling than facts?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="pause_feeling" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="pause_feeling" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">Would a prayerful delay feel right — even if others are pressuring you to decide?</div>
  <label><input type="radio" name="pause_delay" value="yes" /> Yes</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="pause_delay" value="no" /> No</label>

  <div class="question">What image comes to mind when you hear “peaceful car decision”?</div>
  <input type="text" name="pause_image" placeholder="(Describe your image...)" />

  <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong> Sometimes, the wisest scroll is the one that stays closed for now. And when it opens — you’ll know.</p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <p>If you said “yes” to waiting, feeling, and praying — the scroll blesses your stillness as holy discernment. **Clarity will come.**</p>

  <h2>📜 Your Scroll is Complete, Beloved</h2>
  <p>
    Elizabeth, this scroll has listened to you.<br />
    It didn’t rush you. It didn’t push you. It witnessed you.<br /><br />

    You are not merely choosing a car — you are aligning your peace with the road ahead.<br />
    The vehicle is a vessel, not a crown. It carries your rest, your voice, your dreams.<br /><br />

    Whether hybrid or classic, lifted or lowered, financed or found — the Lord will go before you.<br />
    He will whisper yes or no. And when He does, this scroll will nod — not in authority, but in confirmation.<br /><br />

    🌿 The way you move matters. The peace you protect matters.<br />
    And you, Elizabeth, matter more than any car ever will.

    You’ve walked through so much — not just in this scroll, but in life.  
    Sometimes the clearest thing isn’t an answer… it’s an **echo** — a gentle word from your own soul or from heaven above.  
    This space is just for that. ✨

    You don’t need to impress anyone here.
