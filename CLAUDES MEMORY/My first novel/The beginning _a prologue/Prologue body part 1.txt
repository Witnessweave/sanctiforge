PROLOGUE: THE UNSCROLLING

(Part I — The Long Road)

There is a sound to the future, and it is not thunder or the laughter of children, but a ceaseless, distant humming — the resonance of a world wrapped in wires, signals, and electric skin. The highways stretch black and straight to the horizon, shimmering under the ghost-glow of ultraviolet street poles. Out here, nothing is ever silent, but everything feels unspeakably alone.

He drives. He doesn’t remember when the driving became more important than the destinations, or when every sunrise bled together into one endless day. The road hums beneath him, not rubber on asphalt but the weird, unyielding frictionless glide of polarity-matched alloys: his truck floating just above the surface, held aloft by the magnetic breath of a million sensors embedded in the road itself.

Every so often, the cab shivers as the invisible lanes recalibrate. A soft blue pulse flashes in the instrument cluster, and the truck shifts slightly — gently nudged back toward perfect center by the unseen will of the grid. He never touches the wheel unless he must, never asks questions of the system. His hand rests on the shifter, thumb running absent-mindedly over a small worn patch in the leather, the only place where the skin feels warm, human, real.

Beside him, Rocky stirs. The dog, old enough to be wise but young enough to still chase rabbits in his dreams, lifts his head from the seat and looks out the window, nose pressed to the glass, eyes tracking the endless parade of lights. In this world of electric fences and digital watchers, Rocky is a singular grace — a creature who cannot lie, who cannot be programmed, who loves only because it is his nature.

The world beyond the windshield is a tangle of towers. Poles bristle on either side of the highway — some sleek and stainless, some patched and rusting, others crowned with glowing domes, multi-lensed and hungry. Each one broadcasts a different signal: traffic telemetry, city-state alerts, surveillance code, environmental warnings, silent advertisements. Above, drones sweep in slow arcs, their red eyes blinking through the night like distant stars that have lost their way.

He glances at his Eye. The device sits over his left eye, clipped to the frame of his old prescription glasses — a battered black rectangle, with a lens that flickers as it analyzes the world for threats, data, or deviation. It pings once, scanning his vitals.
“Lane integrity: optimal,” the Eye says, in a voice calm as an undertaker.
He grunts and switches it off. He has learned, through years of fatigue and suspicion, that sometimes not knowing is safer.

Rocky watches him, ears twitching at the synthetic voice, then shifts closer, pressing his head against the man’s arm. He scratches the dog behind the ear, more out of habit than affection, but even the smallest touch is enough to remind him he is not alone.

He passes other trucks — long, skeletal haulers with blue-lit undercarriages, their drivers silhouettes behind mirrored glass. Some wear the Eye, others a full helmet — nothing human visible but a flicker of breath behind the visor. Every cab is its own world now, a self-contained ecosystem of data, memory, and resignation.

He rarely speaks to the others. Once, years ago, there were CB radios, laughter, the shared agony of highway boredom. Now the radio is just static, filled with corporate safety bulletins, government code, or the hollow drone of drivers repeating the phrases they have been taught. He can’t remember the last time he heard anyone say something unexpected.

His own cab is different — not just because of Rocky, but because he has chosen to unplug, as much as possible. His truck is old, pre-signal override, retrofitted to block the worst of the network’s reach. He carries his own food, his own music (ancient thumb drives filled with hymns and folk songs), a Bible bound in battered leather. He lives in a cocoon of chosen isolation, the world kept at arm’s length.

But the world will not be held off forever. Tonight, something is different.

A pulse, soft and insistent, flashes across the dash — not the grid’s usual rhythm, but a flicker, like Morse code. Rocky stiffens, ears flat. The man leans forward, narrowing his eyes. For a moment, every pole and drone on the highway seems to blink at once, their lights syncing, the silence deepening.

He feels it then: the faintest tremor in the air, a chill that slips down his spine. Rocky whines, nose pressed to the glass. Out there, on the edge of the road, something moves — not a truck, not a drone, not a coded message. Something human, or trying to be.

He slows. The cab is suddenly very quiet, even the hum of the road muted, as if the whole world is holding its breath. He glances at the Eye, which stays black, dead, as if unwilling to witness what is coming.

Rocky begins to bark, low and warning. The man’s heart hammers. He knows this moment is different. He knows, somehow, that everything he has built to keep the world out is about to be breached.

He stops the truck.

The world outside is a river of darkness and blue light. The figure is standing at the very edge of the road, face hidden beneath a hood, hands clenched tight. For a long moment, neither moves. The man feels the weight of every surveillance node, every drone, every watching eye — and, beneath it all, the sense that something even greater is watching, waiting to see what he will do.

He breathes a prayer he can’t remember ever learning. Rocky is silent now, pressed against his leg, eyes locked on the figure.

The man opens the door, steps down onto the humming road, and the future, at last, begins to unscroll.
