The Merry-Go-Round of Death — A Clearer Witness (≈ 880 words)

Brother Lewis, here is your thought unraveled, restitched, and spoken back in clarity.

1. The Shaping of Fear

From a young age, many children in regions torn by conflict are taught that the “other” is not just different, but an enemy who must be erased. When a child is raised under that belief system, it is not a suggestion — it is indoctrination tied to fear. They are shown violent, graphic consequences of what will happen if they resist the script.

This creates a captive mind, one that believes:

“If I question this, I will be destroyed.”

“If I refuse, my family will pay the price.”

“If I hesitate, I will suffer worse than obedience.”


And so, by the time these children grow into adults, the fear is no longer at the front of their minds — it has sunk deep into their bones. They live by a script, repeating hatred not because it is natural, but because it has been demanded and burned into them through terror.

2. The Public Mask

That is why, when you see people on video, their words often sound full of hatred: “We hate them, we want them gone.” But beneath those words, another layer exists. They know their voices and faces are being recorded. They know someone, somewhere, is watching.

For them, speaking out is not a matter of choice — it is a matter of survival. Even if, in their private hearts, they long for peace or doubt the lies, they cannot show it. Because to show it would invite destruction. And so they comply.

This is not unique to one people. This is a human pattern under oppression: fear forces people to perform the lie until the performance feels real.

3. Forgetting That You Fear

Here is the tragedy: after years of living under this system, many forget that they are acting from fear. They begin to believe the very script they were forced to repeat.

At first, it is obedience out of terror.

Over time, it becomes obedience without question.

Eventually, it feels like identity.


This is how lies take root so deeply that the people themselves defend them as truth. It is not because they freely chose, but because they were shaped to forget the chains they wear.

4. The Carousel We All Ride

Now here is the revelation: this is not only their story. This is all of us. Humanity, in different forms, rides the same carousel.

The poor follow illusions that promise survival.

The middle follow illusions of comfort and approval.

The rich follow illusions of power and control.

The extremely rich often follow illusions so deep they imagine themselves untouchable.


But no matter which horse you ride on this merry-go-round — poverty, wealth, hatred, fear, pride — the machine is the same. It goes in circles, always moving, never delivering life. It is the merry-go-round of death.


---

5. Jesus Has Stepped Off

Yet here is the Gospel truth: Jesus has stepped off the carousel.

He did not ride endlessly in circles. He broke free. He walked a different path — one that leads straight to the Father.

When He says, “Follow Me,” He is not calling us to climb onto another painted horse. He is calling us to step off the ride entirely. To leave behind the cycle of fear, hatred, greed, and lies.

Every ideology, every system, every empire is just another seat on the same carousel. Only Christ breaks the pattern. Only Christ ends the cycle.

6. How We All Live

You asked: “How else would they live? Wouldn’t you?” And the answer is yes — any of us, under the same chains, would do the same. Because humans bend under fear. We all live this way until light breaks in.

We are not so different from those raised in hatred. We too are often taught lies from childhood:

That money is security.

That power is freedom.

That beauty is worth.

That success is salvation.


We also repeat these lies daily until we forget they are lies. We also live under fear — of loss, of death, of rejection. And like them, we comply.


---

7. But the Gospel Is Different

The good news is that we don’t have to stay. We don’t have to ride forever. Jesus has made a way out:

Through His death, He took the curse of the carousel.

Through His resurrection, He broke its power.

Through His Spirit, He guides us off the cycle into eternal life.


So yes, we all live like this — but we do not have to die like this. The merry-go-round ends in death for everyone who stays on it. But those who step off in Christ find life.


---

8. The Witness

And so, when we see people trapped in fear and repeating hatred, our response is not scorn. It is not pride. It is sorrow and compassion. For in them we see ourselves. And in seeing them, we see the desperate need for the Gospel.

They are enslaved by lies. But so were we. And the same Jesus who called us off the carousel is calling them too.


---

9. The Final Word

Truly, only through Him, only by walking with Him, can we leave the endless ride. He is not one option among many. He is the exit gate itself.

Without Him, every path — rich, poor, religious, political — spins back into death.
With Him, the ride stops, the chains break, and the soul is free.

This is why we must speak, why we must learn to reach them, why we must pray. Because the same Lord who freed us longs to free them.
