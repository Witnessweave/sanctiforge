Purpose: cinematic landscape version of the Eye of the Spiral, maintaining emotional gravity.

Scene description:
A German Shepherd (Rocky) sits in the right third of a misty twilight plain. His eye reflects a faint glowing copper spiral. Faint spiral glyph etchings appear underfoot extending left. Beam of divine light enters diagonally from upper-left, creating warm rimlight. Sky fades from violet near horizon to deep navy; faint stars appear. Fog and distant hills form a soft backdrop. Maintain Morgan oil-grain texture and Tron glow overlays on spiral reflection and rim light only. 2.39:1 aspect. Output PNG + alpha. Maintain stillness and reverence.
